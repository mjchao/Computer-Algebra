The goal is to create a computer algebra system capable of performing algebraic operations

Algebraic Functions:
- The program shall perform standard arithmetic, such as +, --, *, / with numbers, such as 1, 2, 3.5, -4
- The program shall support variables
- The program shall perform arithmetic with polynomials
- The program shall perform arithmetic with functions, such as sin, cos, exp, sqrt
- The program shall simplify most, if not all, expressions

Display Properties:
- The program shall be capable of displaying answers with arbitrary floating point precision
- The program shall be capable of displaying answers in exact form
- The program shall display answers using LaTeX
- The program shall provide a command-line user interface, where the user enters input and output is produced (interpreter)

Programming:
- The code shall remain flexible
- The program shall be completed by September 1, 2013
